## Pickling and Unpickling:

The pickle module is used for implementing binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. 
 
Pickling: It is a process where a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream. 
 
Unpickling: It is the inverse of Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an object hierarchy. 
 

Module Interface : 
 
dumps() – This function is called to serialize an object hierarchy.
loads() – This function is called to de-serialize a data stream.


Constants provided by the pickle module : 

pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL 
This is an integer value representing the highest protocol version available. This is considered as the protocol value which is passed to the 
functions dump(), dumps(). 
 
pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL 
This is an integer value representing the default protocol used for pickling whose value may be less than the value of the highest protocol. 



Functions provided by the pickle module : 
 
pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol = None, *, fix_imports = True) 
This function is equivalent to Pickler(file, protocol).dump(obj). This is used to write a pickled representation of obj to the open file 
object file.
The optional protocol argument is an integer that tells the pickler to use the given protocol. The supported protocols are 0 to HIGHEST_PROTOCOL. 
If not specified, the default is DEFAULT_PROTOCOL. If a negative number is specified, HIGHEST_PROTOCOL is selected.
If fix_imports is true and protocol is less than 3, the pickle will try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python 2, 
so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2. 


pickle.dumps(obj, protocol = None, *, fix_imports = True) 
This function returns the pickled representation of the object as a bytes object.


pickle.load(file, *, fix_imports = True, encoding = “ASCII”, errors = “strict”) 
This function is equivalent to Unpickler(file).load(). This function is used to read a pickled object representation from the open file object 
file and return the reconstituted object hierarchy specified.


pickle.loads(bytes_object, *, fix_imports = True, encoding = “ASCII”, errors = “strict”) 
This function is used to read a pickled object representation from a bytes object and return the reconstituted object hierarchy specified.
